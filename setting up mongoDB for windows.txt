Download and install the mongoDB client for windows from https://www.mongodb.org/downloads
Add the \bin directory wherever you installed mongoDB (e.g. C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.0\bin) to your windows PATH variable
Create the folder where you want mongoDB to store its data
Open a command line or powershell with admin rights (right-click, open as admin)
Run this command to get a server going
	mongod.exe -dbpath <your mongoDB database folder>
e.g.
	mongod.exe -dbpath D:\Data\mongoDB
This will start a local server at 127.0.0.1 which other applications can access
Start another terminal
Import your json file(s). The database you created earlier contains its own databases, and these contain collections. For example, I have a database called RTO_20150929 (date I downloaded the data), which collections 'subjects' and 'classifications'.
	mongoimport -db <name of database> -collection <name of collection> -file <path to your json, ending in .json>
Now add all necessary collections to your database.

On my Windows, I always need to have a server running (mongod -dbpath <mongoDB folder>) in order to access my mongoDB database through pyCharm or robomongo; not sure if this can be prevented or is not necessary on iOS. 

Then, with the server running, in pyCharm you can do things like:
	dbConnection = MongoClient("localhost", 27017)
	handleToData = dbConnection.<name of your db>.<name of classification>
Count number of entries in JSON
	handleToData.count()
And close the connection at the end of your script, like you would close a handle to any file
	dbConnection.close()
