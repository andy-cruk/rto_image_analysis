The results file (e.g. RtO_results_p21_clean.xlsx) contains one row per core and one column for each measure of that core.
The cores are identified in the 'core' column:
core: a 4-digit identifier and stain type (e.g. '7797 p21')

What follows are 3 sets of 5 columns. The sets are:
'raw': scores calculated across users and segments of each core.
'corrected': same as 'raw', except have had a linear correction applied to the intensity and proportion scores scores based on the expert scores. These corrected proportion and intensity scores are then used to calculate the H-score, Allred-like and proportion category.
'expert': expert scores are represented for those cores that were scored by experts.

Our recommendation is to use the 'corrected' scores as citizen science scores for purposes of reporting, regression on patient outcomes, and so forth. More details on the calculation of these scores will be made available.

The 5 columns for each of these 3 sets are as follows:
proportion: value between 0 and 100 indicating proportion of cancer cells stained
proportion category: value between 0 and 5 indicating proportion stained as category. Cut-offs for category are based on the categories in RtO (0, 1-25, 25-50, 50-75, 75-95, 95-100)
intensity: value between 0 and 3 indicating intensity of staining
H-score: product of 'proportion' and 'intensity', between 0 and 300.
Allred-like: addition of 'proportion category' and 'intensity', between 0 and 8. It is not quite Allred because the proportion categories for Allred are defined differently from the ones used here.
