- Download and install the mongoDB client for windows from https://www.mongodb.org/downloads
- Add the \bin directory wherever you installed mongoDB (e.g. C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.0\bin) to your windows PATH variable (http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm)
- Create the folder where you want mongoDB to store its data (e.g. D:\Data\mongoDB)
- Create a text file to refer to later, e.g. at C:\mongo.txt
- Open a command line or powershell with admin rights (right-click, open as admin)
- Run this command to get a server going
	mongod --install --dbpath <your database path, e.g. D:\Data\mongoDB> --logpath <wherever you created text file, e.g. C:\mongo.txt>
	mongod --install --dbpath D:\Data\mongoDB --logpath C:\mongo.txt
	mongod --service
	Alternatively to --service, you might have to use
	net start MongoDB
	Always check your logfile
- Restart your computer, it should have the server running in the background now. You can check this by starting Robomongo which should have no trouble setting up a new connection to your local 127.0.0.1 server (download here: http://robomongo.org/)
- get the RtO json file by 1) asking Sarah to give you a download link for a .gz file; 2) unzip that gz file to get a file without extension; 3) unzip that again and you get 3 json files;
- Import your json file(s). The database you created earlier contains its own databases, and these contain collections. For example, I have a database called RTO_20150929 (date I downloaded the data), which collections 'subjects' and 'classifications'.
	mongoimport --db <name of database> --collection <name of collection> --file <path to your json, ending in .json>
    mongoimport --db RTO_20161029 --collection classifications --file H:\2016_CitSci\sanitized_hard_cell_2016-10-29\hard_cell_classifications.json
- Now add all necessary collections to your database

In pyCharm you can do things like:
    from pymongo import MongoClient
	dbConnection = MongoClient("localhost", 27017)
	handleToData = dbConnection.<name of your db>.<name of classification>
Count number of entries in JSON
	handleToData.count()
And close the connection at the end of your script, like you would close a handle to any file
	dbConnection.close()


To ever upgrade your mongodb
- download latest msi https://www.mongodb.org/downloads
- stop your mongod instance by opening a terminal in e.g. robomongo
    use admin
    db.shutdownServer()
- install new mongodb into e.g. C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<your version>\ (default)
- change Windows PATH to new version
- check your new version by typing into shell
    mongod --version
- now input the following (change dbpath to wherever your mongodb data is)
    mongod --remove
    mongod --install --dbpath D:\Data\mongoDB --logpath C:\mongo2.txt
    net start MongoDB
- now you're good to go
